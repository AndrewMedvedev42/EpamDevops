## PART 3 â€“ MongoDB

1. Create a database. Use the use command to connect to a new database (If it doesn't exist, Mongo will create it when you write to it).

2. Create a collection. Use db.createCollection to create a collection. I'll leave the subject up to you. Run show dbs and show collections to view your database andcollections.

3. Create some documents. Insert a couple of documents into your collection. I'll leave the subject matter up to you, perhaps cars or hats.

4. Use find() to list documents out.
